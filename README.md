# ðŸ”— Embed Fixer âš¡
A tiny Discord bot that fixes embeds &amp; video players for media.discordapp.net URLs by redirecting them to the Discord CDN.

## What does it do?
Discord has this really annoying issue where if you copy the link of some particular videos, the resulting URL is addressed at `media.discordapp.net` instead of `cdn.discordapp.com`, and as a result the video does not play.

This is a simple Discord bot that fixes the URL and replies with the fixed link, so the video can be viewed without the user having to manipulate the link.
